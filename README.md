# UnquotedServicePathFinder
It finds unquoted service paths.
I wanted a automated tool to look for bug bountyies so I made this in a afternoon. If anyone has any recomendations or fixes please let me know or make a pull request. If someone gets a bugbounty with this tool let me know. I only tested it twice if there is bugs or it doesnt find them all please let me know.
